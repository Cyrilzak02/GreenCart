# GreenCart

This is a site i made for a class i had last semester. It's a basic site that helps organic products producers sell their products and for  buyers, to buy these products.
The languages that were used for the creation of the site are: PHP, HTML , CSS and Javascript. It's the first time i did a project with the help of github.
